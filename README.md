# Numerical Linear Algebra
 
**Numerical Linear Algebra** is a branch of mathematics that focuses on the development and analysis of algorithms for solving linear algebra problems with finite precision arithmetic. It encompasses a wide range of topics, including matrix operations, solving linear systems, eigenvalue problems, and matrix factorizations. The primary goal is to develop efficient and stable numerical methods that can be implemented on computers to solve problems arising in various scientific and engineering applications.

## Repository Implementations

This repository contains numerical linear algebra implementations, organized into separate folders. Each folder includes:

- An algorithm description written in the README file.
- A Python implementation of the algorithm.
